## Day Highlights

Day 3 began with a beautiful recitation of the Holy Quran by Br. Abdullah Ammar, followed by an insightful Hadeeth session delivered by Br. Saqib Khan. The main session of the morning focused on the effective utilization of social media, presented by Ali Ahmad Sb., who shared valuable insights on how to use social media platforms responsibly and beneficially from an Islamic perspective.

The participants then engaged in a movie screening session, which provided visual examples of effective communication and storytelling techniques. This was followed by a refreshment break, after which all participants took part in a creative story creation workshop.

The story creation activity encouraged participants to develop their creative writing skills while incorporating Islamic values and lessons. Participants worked individually and in groups to craft engaging narratives, which they later shared with the entire camp.

Throughout the day, the campers showed great enthusiasm and creativity, making Day 3 both educational and enjoyable. The day concluded with the story creation presentations, showcasing the participants' newfound skills in storytelling and creative expression.
