## Day Highlights

The day began with a beautiful recitation from the Holy Quran by Sheikh Ahmed Yaseen, followed by an enlightening Hadeeth session by Br. Abdullah Ammar. Dr. Muhiuddin Ghazi then led an interactive session on character development, emphasizing the importance of good moral conduct in Islam.

The participants were fully engaged in the group activities, which were designed to reinforce the concepts learned during the educational sessions. The Brain Teaser activity challenged their minds, while the Treasure Hunt provided a fun way to work together and apply problem-solving skills.

Throughout the day, campers demonstrated enthusiasm and active participation, making the sessions both educational and enjoyable. The day concluded with the Treasure Hunt activity, which was a highlight for many participants.
