## Day Highlights

Day 6 of Rihla Summer Camp-2025 was dedicated to an educational field trip that combined learning with fun outdoor activities. The day began with participants gathering at The Scholar School, from where they departed for the Nehru Planetarium.

At the planetarium, campers were treated to an immersive experience exploring the wonders of space through interactive exhibits. The highlight was an exciting sky show that captivated everyone's imagination with stunning visuals of celestial bodies and cosmic phenomena. The planetarium visit provided valuable scientific knowledge while inspiring awe about the vastness of the universe created by Allah.

Following the planetarium visit, the group headed to the serene Nehru Park for a refreshing break amidst nature. The lush greenery offered a perfect setting for relaxation and reflection. Participants enjoyed a delicious lunch together, strengthening the bonds of brotherhood formed throughout the camp.

The day concluded with a Creative Drawing Competition held in the natural setting of the park. Young artists showcased their talents, drawing inspiration from both their planetarium experience and the beautiful surroundings. The outdoor setting added a unique dimension to their creativity, resulting in impressive artwork.

Throughout the day, campers not only gained scientific knowledge but also experienced the joy of learning outside conventional classroom settings. The trip perfectly aligned with the camp's holistic approach to education, combining Islamic values with modern scientific understanding and creative expression.

The educational trip served as a wonderful change of pace from the regular camp schedule and provided memories that will last long after the camp concludes.
